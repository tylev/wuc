# For Web developers / Designers / Translators

Each localized version of weusecoins is independent of each other and use static HTML, CSS or PHP files.

That allows us to adapt anything to best fit each languages requirements and available resources, businesses or active groups. That includes the html, fonts, css, scripts, social networks, etc. And that allows us to update other languages when a translator is missing for a specific language.

The materials directory is used as a shared directory to store files that take more disk space, such as the weusecoins video.

Please contribute and help fix any broken links, bugs, etc.

Thanks!

# What not to do

For obvious reasons, you should not change the meaning of any text or add or change links. Such changes must be discussed first.
You are can add links to community or news websites in the community section that might be appropriate for each language.

# Keep the same html structure

Keep html structure as symetric and perfectly identical as possible between each pages, and each localized version. This should not prevent you to add unique things for some languages. But you can keep the rest exactly as it is.
